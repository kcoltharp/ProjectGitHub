						Question: Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snacking on. Is it OK for the dog
						to eat chocolate?
					</dt>
						<dd>
							Answer: Chocolate is toxic for dogs. Please do not feed your dog chocolate. Try playing a
							game with your children&mdash;when you feed them people treats, they can feed Sparky dog 
							treats.
